"""
Script: build_specLambda_root.py

Purpose:
    Batch-extract TGraphErrors and TGraphAsymmErrors objects from multiple ROOT files
    based on a CSV mapping file, rename them, and consolidate into a single output ROOT file.

Usage:
    1. Prepare a CSV file (default name: graph_mapping.csv) with columns:
       file, table, graph, cent, category
    2. Adjust the `csv_path` variable if the CSV is located elsewhere.
    3. Run the script: python build_specLambda_root.py
    4. The extracted graphs will be saved into 'spec_lambda_infered.root'.

CSV Format:
    file      - Path to input ROOT file
    table     - Directory name within the ROOT file
    graph     - Name of the TGraphErrors or TGraphAsymmErrors object
    cent      - Centrality label used in output graph name
    category  - Category label used in output graph name
